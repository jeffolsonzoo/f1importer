# f1importer
A quick set of Groovy scripts that I wrote to import my church's Church Helpmate and NSpire data into our new Fellowship One church management system.

This would definitely take some work to customize for a different conversion project, but I thought I would release it here in case it is helpful for anyone else to serve as a starting point.
